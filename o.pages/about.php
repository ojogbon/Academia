      <p class="lead  pt-3">Academia O is a marketplace for those seeking Home Tutoring services to connect with those seeking to provide Home Tutoring services. Academia O also provides a pass-through payment processing service to its users, meaning that payments distributed to Home Tutors originate from their clients. Academia O offers Home Tutors a layer of protection in the collection of their funds but, if any of the following conditions are not met and Academia O becomes unable to collect your payment from the parent, client, or other type of account-holder to whom you gave a tutorial, Academia O cannot guarantee that your payment will be successfully collected, processed and distributed to you:</p>
      <ol  class="list-group ">

        <p>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            1. The information pertaining to the tutorial must be accurate. This includes the start and end time, duration, subject and client account name. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Home Tutor and client, the start and end time will be considered to be the times of the actual Home Tutoring tutorial, not arrival and departure times to and from the Home Tutoring location.

          <span id="dots"></span>
          <span id="more">

            <li class="list-group-item">2. Prior to each tutorial being given, the client must have paid in full using the Academia O payment system. This includes bank deposit, internet or mobile transfer. The Home Tutors can view the status of the client's payment information through the Home Tutor's Academia O account on our website or constantly call the administrative officer in charge for updates. The requirement to make upfront payments for all tutorials must be followed for existing clients as well as new clients.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">3. The tutorial is delivered in-person at a mutually agreed upon location. If the tutorial is delivered remotely through another medium, such as via the internet, email, telephone or Skype, or in the instance when the Home Tutor does proofreading or other asynchronous, non-Home Tutoring work with the client, the Home Tutor must obtain written confirmation from the client to Academia O and to be submitted at our office or via email address; academiao.mail@gmail.com, that acknowledges the nature of the work to be done and the expectations of the time and cost required to complete the work.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">4. The Home Tutor's services are instructive and constitute learning, not cheating. More specifically, the Home Tutor is not to complete assignments, write papers, take quizzes or otherwise do work on the client's behalf. Furthermore, the services that the Home Tutor offers must not violate the academic honesty policy or other conduct policies of the client's school or academic institution.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">5. The Home Tutor enters the tutorial taught into their log book. Payment for tutorials not entered into the log book cannot be processed. Clients will have up to 3 days to confirm tutorials or raise complaints after which payments shall be processed.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">6. Prior to a tutorial being given, the Home Tutor has received a Academia O subject approval for the specific subject area of the tutorial.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">7. The Home Tutor does not collect or request payment directly from the client by cash, cheque or otherwise, for the tutorial.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">8. For any cancellation (which is in line with our cancellation policy) of the tutorial course by the client, the tutor will be payed after a mutual agreement is reached, except for severe cases such as health challenge, death etc.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">9. The Home Tutor is over 18 years old and is eligible to work in Nigeria.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">10. The Home Tutor agrees to all Federal and Local laws while engaged in providing tutoring services to the Clients.</li>

If there are questions about any of the conditions above, payments may be delayed while Academia O attempts to resolve the problem. By default, a Home Tutor is paid by electronic transfer to the Home Tutor’s bank account within 48 hours after the completion of the tutorial course. The time between when the funds are released by Academia O and made available to the Home Tutor by the Home Tutor's bank may vary and is controlled by the Home Tutor's bank, not by Academia O. If a Home Tutor's direct deposit is returned to Academia O by the Home Tutor's bank, Academia O will request that the Home Tutor correct the Home Tutor’s bank information. The returned payment amount will be resent within five (5) days after the bank information is corrected.</li>

          <li class="list-group-item">2. On no account must the Home Tutor make friends, mingle or relate with the student or client aside the tutorial aims. There should be no form of exchange of phone numbers, social media ID or whatsoever contact information between the Home Tutor and the student. Any vital information needed to be passed across to the student or Client outside tutorial hours must be channeled through Academia O.</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">3. Our monitoring team will occasionally pay a visit to the tutorial location at any time without prior notification from Academia O to ensure that all these rules are kept and that tutorials are properly delivered. Any Home Tutor found violating any of the rules will be sanctioned accordingly.</li>
